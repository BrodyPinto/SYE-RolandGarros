## Abstract

- In tennis, mental skill is just as important as physical ability.

- This project explores how elite players handle pressure situations (i.e., important points) to gain an edge over their opponents.

- Shot trajectory data - with precise ball coordinates - from the 2019-2023 French Open tournaments was used.

- The analysis required: extensive data cleaning, parsing of match scores, joining multiple data sources.

- These steps enabled the creation of visualizations showing how elite players serve and return during high-pressure points.

- **Key findings:**

  - On serve, elite players tend to stick to their strengths and even play more aggressively under pressure (depending on their opponent).

  - On return, elite players generally adopt a more conservative approach to their current strategy.

## 1. Introduction

- Outline the rest of the paper.

- Motivation: Pressure points are few and far between but have a disproportionately large impact on the state of the entire match.

- Prior work: Kovalchikâ€™s paper, other work?

- Research question: How do elite players adapt tactically under pressure?

## 2. Data and Methods

### 2.1 Data Sources
- Primary data source: Infosys tracking data (Roland Garros)

  - talk about scraping?

- `atp_importance` from the `deuce` package

- Player data from Jeff Sackmann

### 2.2 Data Processing
- talk about all the functions and how they work together to build the all_matches dateset I use in filter_matches().

- Standardizing player names and match scores for importance joining with all_matches to create the final all_matches_importance dataset = the final state of data prep

- Coordinate normalization and court alignment to keep aspect ratio / scale of the court

### 2.3 Data Summary Tables

### 2.4 Visualization
- 2D density plots of serve and return locations

- Score/important point and opponent strategy comparisons

## 3. Case Studies
### 3.1 Rafael Nadal (2022)
- Serves on break points: more margin, similar targets

### Zverev Serves

### 3.2 Iga Swiatek (2023)
- Consistent center targeting under pressure

### 3.3 Novak Djokovic (2021)
- Elite return depth and accuracy on important points

### Someone else for returns

## 4. Discussion (embed into Case Studies section, general discussion can go into Conclusion)
- Tactical trends: aggression vs. safety, overall tactical change between important / non-important points

- Differences across ATP and WTA examples

## 5. Conclusion
- Players adapt differently under pressure:

  - On **serve**, Nadal and Swiatek often maintain their strategy but play *more aggressively* on important points.
  
  - On **return**, Djokovic prioritizes consistency in high-stakes moments.

- Only **~17%** of all points are labeled as important, but they have a disproportionately large impact on match outcomes.

- **Shot placement data** allows us to visualize elite players' serve and return patterns in response to pressure, enabling more nuanced performance analysis.

- Future work - rally shots instead of just serve/return
